This is simply a RFID reader code that work using an ESP-32-C3 mini (or super-mini idk) and a PN532 RFID Module connected via I2C.
Currently trying to figure out how to write on a tag to clone an existing card UID. (for personnal and non-malicious intent of course)
(Screnshot of the ESP32-C3 I use)![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69db7d6e-f3b7-4b2a-879c-6c831ccec9bc)
